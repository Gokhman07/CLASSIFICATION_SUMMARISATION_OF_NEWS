# CLASSIFICATION_SUMMARISATION_OF_NEWS
Automated news article classification and summarization are critical natural language processing tasks that aid in organizing vast amounts of news content and delivering concise, informative summaries to users. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of various techniques for news article classification and summarization. We evaluate popular machine learning models, such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and DistilBERT for a classification task that involves classifying article categories based solely on their titles. We employ abstractive and extractive summarization models, such as Pegasus, T5, and GPT2, for generating summaries. The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises diverse news articles from multiple sources. We analyze the performance of these models through various evaluation metrics. The findings of this study shed light on the strengths and limitations of different approaches, providing valuable insights for advancing the field of news article classification and summarization. This can inform potential applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios , including content organization, recommendation systems, and information dissemination platforms.
